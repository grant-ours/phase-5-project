Discord like chatroom app!

### A live version of this website is deployed using Render here:
[Live Version](https://discode-1zsp.onrender.com/)

This is definitely the project I am most happy with!  I used Webhooks and Redis to allow for users to see each others chats without refreshing the page.  A quicker connection between server and webpage but as I said unfortunately the chat feature does not work on the live site.
